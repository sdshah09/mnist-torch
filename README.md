# PyTorch MNIST Dataset Exploration and Analysis

Welcome to the PyTorch MNIST Dataset Exploration and Analysis repository! This project is dedicated to working with the MNIST dataset using PyTorch, a widely-used deep learning framework. MNIST is a benchmark dataset in machine learning and computer vision, comprising 60,000 training images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).

## Project Overview

In this project, we delve into various aspects of the MNIST dataset, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. Our primary objectives are as follows:

- **Data Preparation**: Utilize PyTorch's data loading capabilities to preprocess and augment the MNIST dataset.
- **Model Implementation**: Design, implement, and train neural network models for digit classification tasks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization**: Visualize model training progress, including loss curves, accuracy trends, and misclassified samples.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Explore techniques for enhancing model performance, such as hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and optimization algorithms.
